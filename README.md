# UniHelp Help Desk Support System
The goal of this project  is to create a universal software where individual companies can register for an account in order to manage support tickets submitted to them by users of their products. 
- The software will allow for companies to tailor the set up of the support ticket functionality specifically to the companies needs by allowing them to designate multiple levels of support.
- Submitted tickets will then be able to be managed within the confines of their designated support level, or elevated to higher levels so that they can be solved in a timely manner.
- Tickets can be filtered and sorted by factors such as date of creation or priority level depending on the specific needs of the company.
